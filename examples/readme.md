# Workshop Examples

In this directory you will find example projects from ofxPiMapper workshops in the past. There are folders that are named according to the date of the first day of the workshop. **2016-05-14** means **14 May 2016**.

The examples are supposed to be placed in the `openFrameworks/apps/myApps/` directory. If you have a different apps category folder (e.g. `openFrameworks/apps/test/` or `openFrameworks/apps/kittens/`), you can place the examples there as well.

Feel free to improve and submit pull requests.
