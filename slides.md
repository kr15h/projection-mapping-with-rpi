# Using Own Sources

Find some image and / or video sources that you want to use. 

**Images**: jpg, jpeg, png (2000 x 2000px max)
**Videos**: mp4 (H.264 encoding, 1280 x 720px)

---

# Video Encoding Tools

Use HandBrake to encode your videos. You can download it from the following website.

**handbrake.fr**

Use the **Fast 720p30** preset for encoding.

---

# Stealing Videos from YouTube

Stealing is not good, but sometimes useful. Remember Picaso once said: Good artists copy, great artists STEAL.

---

## Using VLC

- Open VLC. Go to File / Open Network.
- Click on Window / Media Info.
- Copy the Location field value.

---

## Use **ssyoutube.com** instead of **youtube.com**

- Open your favorite web browser software.
- Go to youtube.com and look for your video.
- Once found, add ss in front of youtube.com.
- Download your video.

---

# Encoding with FFmpeg

In case you decide to use **FFmpeg** (cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video), here is a basic command you can use.

```
ffmpeg -i source.mov -vf scale=w=1280:h=720 destination.mp4
```

Website: **ffmpeg.org**

---

# Cutting Video w/ ffmpeg

the `-ss` parameter tells where to start to cut and the `-t` defines how long is the slice you want to cut from there.

```
ffmpeg -i flower.mov -ss 00:00:02 -t 00:01:00 flower.mp4
```

---

# Crop Video w/ ffmpeg

Here you focus on the `crop=...` part. The structure is the following `crop=width:height:x:y`. The final video is going to be in the size of `width` and `height`. The `x` and `y` defines where we start to cut the video.

```
ffmpeg -i "sprites.mov" -filter:v "crop=640:570:0:35" "sprites.mp4" 
```

--- 

# Speeding up Video with ffmpeg

Replace the `4` and `4x` with a multiplier (how many times you want to upspeed your video).

```
ffmpeg -i "original.mp4" -filter:v "setpts=PTS/4" "upspeed-4x.mp4"
```

What happens here is that a ffmpeg filter is used to `setpts` `N` times less than the original `PTS` (Presentation Time Stamp).

---

# Network Setup

In order to get the most out of it, we have to configure Raspberry Pi network connection.

Type: **ext** to enter the command line interface (CLI) of the Raspberry Pi.

---

# WiFi Configuration

Use the following command on the Raspberry Pi.

```
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

---

# Editing WiFi Config

```
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Change the `ssid` and `psk`.

```
network={
        ssid="YOUR_SSID"
        psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```

---

# Unsecured Networks

In case your WiFi network is open, use the following.

```
network={
        ssid="YOUR_SSID"
        key_mgmt=NONE
}
```

---

# Finalizing WiFi Setup

Replace with your network credentials. Hit **CTRL+X** and **Y** and **ENTER** to save and exit. Use the following to reboot.

```
sudo reboot
```

---

# Getting IP Address

Use the following command to see the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

```
hostname -I
```

You should see output similar to **192.168.0.3**. Note it down somewhere.

---

# Uploading via SFTP

Raspberry Pi uses the **S**ecure **SH**ell protocol and that works with file transfers as well. Get one of the following.

**FileZilla** (filezilla-project.org)
**WinSCP** Windows only (winscp.net)

---

# Credentials

Host: 192.168.1.XXX
Username: pi
Password: raspberry
Port: 22

---

# Using SCP

You can also use the command line interface to upload files. The following will upload `movie-a.mp4` and `movie-b.mp4` to the `example_gamepad` video source folder.

```
scp movie-a.mp4 movie-b.mp4 \
pi@192.168.0.3:/home/pi/openFrameworks/addons/\
ofxPiMapper/example_gamepad/bin/data/sources/videos/
```

---

# Connecting to the Pi

Use the **inet addr** from before

Username: **pi**
Password: **raspberry**

If you want to be safe, use the RasPi config tool to change the password.

```
sudo raspi-config
```

---

# Uploading

```
/home/pi
/openFrameworks/addons
/ofxPiMapper/example_gamepad/bin/data/sources
```

Put images and videos in the respective folders. Reboot.

```
sudo reboot
```

---

# Secure SHell

SSH is a secure network protocol for controlling another computer through a network.

**Mac and Linux**: use Terminal
**Windows**: Get PuTTY (putty.org)

---

# Connecting via Terminal

Use the following command.

```
ssh pi@192.168.0.3
```

Replace the IP address with the one your Pi has. Enter password (**raspberry**) when asked to do so.

If you get a question about certificates, type **yes** and hit **ENTER**.

---

# Connecting via PuTTY

Use the following credentials to establish connection.

**Hostname**: 192.168.0.3 (replace this)
**Username**: pi
**Password**: raspberry

---

# Command Line 101

```
pwd 	    Print working directory
ls 		    List directory
ls -l 		List with options
ls -al 		List including hidden files with options
cd /my/dir  Change directory to /my/dir
cd ..       Change directory to one level up
cd          Go to home directory of user pi
```

---

# Create Text File

```
# Create empty file.txt
touch file.txt  

# To add or replace content.
echo "Add new line" >> file.txt
echo "Overwrite everything" > file.txt
```

---

# Read Text File

```
cat file.txt    Read short file
less file.txt   Read big file (hit Q to exit)
nano file.txt   Edit file with nano
```

Use **CTRL + X** to exit. Nano will ask if you sure. Hit **Y** to confirm and **ENTER** to write to the file.

---

# Troubleshooting

In case your terminal is not behaving as expected, try to use the following key combination to exit the frozen state.

**CTRL + C**

If that does not help, do a **hard reboot** by unplugging the power source.

---

# Powering up and down

Use one of the following to **reboot**.

```
sudo reboot
```

Use one of the following to **shutdown**.

```
sudo halt
```

---
