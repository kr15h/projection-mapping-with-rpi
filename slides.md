# Software

We are going to use open source projection mapping addon for openFrameworks. **ofxPiMapper**.

- Started as my MA thesis at Media Lab Helsinki
- Integrates with openFrameworks
- Runs also on Mac, Linux and Windows

---

# Download

Go to the following web address.

**ofxpimapper.com**

Click on **Download latest**.

---

# Burning SD Card

Please follow the link to access the instructions page.

**http://ej.uz/sd-card-burning-guides**

---

# Shortcuts

You can find an ever updating version of keyboard shortcuts on the ofxPiMapper GitHub repository.

**https://github.com/kr15h/ofxPiMapper**

Make sure you have selected the **stable** branch.

---

# Experiment

---

# Own Sources

Find some image and / or video sources that you want to use. 

**Images**: jpg, jpeg, png (2000 x 2000px max)
**Videos**: mp4 (H.264 encoding, 1280 x 720px)

---

# Video Encoding Tools

Use HandBrake to encode your videos. You can download it from the following website.

**handbrake.fr**

Use the **Fast 720p30** preset for encoding.
Use the **Fast 1080p30** if using single video.

---

# Encoding with FFmpeg

In case you decide to use **FFmpeg** (cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video), here is a basic command you can use.

```
ffmpeg -i source.mov -vf scale=w=1280:h=720 destination.mp4
```

Website: **ffmpeg.org**

---

# Configure WiFi

Use the following command on the Raspberry Pi.

```
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Replace with your network credentials. Hit CTRL+X and Y and ENTER to save and exit. Use the following to reboot.

```
sudo reboot
```

---

# Getting IP Address

Use the following command to see the IP address of the Raspberry Pi wireless network adapter.

```
ifconfig
```

Look for **wlan0** and **inet addr**. It should look like **192.168.0.3** Note it down somewhere.

---

# Getting a SFTP Client

Raspberry Pi uses the **S**ecure **SH**ell protocol and that works with file transfers as well. Get one of the following.

**FileZilla** (filezilla-project.org)
**WinSCP** Windows only (winscp.net)

---

# Connecting to the Pi

Use the **inet addr** from before

Username: **pi**
Password: **raspberry**

---

# Uploading

```
/home/pi
/openFrameworks/addons
/ofxPiMapper/example/bin/data/sources
```

Put images and videos in the respective folders. Reboot.

```
sudo reboot
```

---

# Secure SHell

SSH is a secure network protocol for controlling another computer through a network.

**Mac and Linux**: use Terminal
**Windows**: Get PuTTY (putty.org)

---

# Connecting via Terminal

Use the following command.

```
ssh pi@192.168.0.3
```

Replace the IP address with the one your Pi has. Enter password (**raspberry**) when asked to do so.

If you get a question about certificates, type **yes** and hit **ENTER**.

---

# Connecting via PuTTY

Use the following credentials to establish connection.

**Hostname**: 192.168.0.3 (replace this)
**Username**: pi
**Password**: raspberry

---

# Killing the Example App

In order to stop the running ofxPiMapper example application, run this command.

```
sudo killall example
```

---

# Command Line 101

```
pwd 	    Print working directory
ls 		    List directory
ls -l 		List with options
ls -al 		List including hidden files with options
cd /my/dir  Change directory to /my/dir
cd ..       Change directory to one level up
cd          Go to home directory of user pi
```

---

# Create Text File

```
# Create empty file.txt
touch file.txt  

# To add or replace content.
echo "Add new line" >> file.txt
echo "Overwrite everything" > file.txt
```

---

# Read Text File

```
cat file.txt    Read short file
less file.txt   Read big file (hit Q to exit)
nano file.txt   Edit file with nano
```

Use **CTRL + X** to exit. Nano will ask if you sure. Hit **Y** to confirm and **ENTER** to write to the file.

---

# Troubleshooting

In case your terminal is not behaving as expected, try to use the following key combination to exit the frozen state.

**CTRL + C**

If that does not help, do a hard reboot by unplugging the power source.

---

# Keeping System up to Date

Use the following commands to update your Raspberry Pi.

```
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

The *update* and *upgrade* commands will take a while. That's normal.

---

# Powering up and down

Use one of the following to **reboot**.

```
sudo reboot
sudo shutdown -r now
```

Use one of the following to **shutdown**.

```
sudo halt
sudo shutdown -h now
```

---

# Launch on Boot with Crontab

Cron is job scheduler software available on UNIX-like systems.

Run the following command to edit `crontab`.

```
crontab -e
```

---

# Edit Crontab

Add the following to the crontab file to launch ofxPiMapper example on boot.

```
@reboot /home/pi/openFrameworks/addons/ofxPiMapper/example/bin/example
```

Press **CTRL + X** to exit. Hit **Y** to confirm changes and **ENTER** to write to file.

---

# Crontab Fields

```
field          allowed values
-----          --------------
minute         0-59
hour           0-23
day of month   1-31
month          1-12 
day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday)
```

---

# Keep ofxPiMapper up to Date

Go to ofxPiMapper addon directory.

```
cd /home/pi/openFrameworks/addons/ofxPiMapper
```

Make sure you use the `stable` branch and pull in latest changes. Use the following command.

```
git branch
```

---

# Pull in updates

If stable branch is not present use the following.

```
git checkout -b stable
git pull origin stable

```

If the stable branch is there, use this.

```
git checkout stable
git pull origin stable
```

---

# Recompile Example

At this point you should recompile the example.

```
cd example
make && make run
```

If you are using ofxPiMapper for your own project, recompile the project.





---

# Uploading Basic Examples

1. Connect to Pi with **FileZilla** or **WinSCP**
2. /home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps
3. Drop **yourApp** folder there

---

# Compiling Basic Examples

1. Use **Terminal** or **PuTTY** to connect to your Pi
2. cd /home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/**yourApp**
3. type **make** and when it completes **make run**

---

# Backing up on Mac

Make sure that you do not expand the filesystem of the disk image provided during the workshop.

```
diskutil list
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN
sudo dd if=/dev/rdiskN of=./backup.img bs=1m count=3700
```

---

# Backink up on Windows

Use **Win32DiskImager** to back up your SD card.

1. Select SD card drive from the list
2. Click on the folder icon
3. Select where to save the **_.img** on disk
4. Click **Open**
5. Click **Read**

---

# Changing WiFi Network

```
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Change the `ssid` and `psk`.

```
network={
        ssid="Your SSID"
        psk="Your password"
}
```

---

# [fit] Installing openFrameworks

Once you have the OS (like Raspbian) installed on your SD card, the next step is to install *openFrameworks*. To do that, follow the guide available on the official openFrameworks website.

```
http://openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/raspberry-pi-getting-started/
```

---

# [fit] Installing ofxPiMapper

Use the following.

```
cd /home/pi/openFrameworks/addons
git clone https://github.com/kr15h/ofxPiMapper.git
git clone https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer.git
git clone https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIO.git
cd /home/pi/openFrameworks/addons/ofxPiMapper/example
make
```
